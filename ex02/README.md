## Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams  

### Description  

In this exercise, I had to step into the role of a new developer at **GlobalBanksters United**, where a critical source file, `Account.cpp`, was accidentally deleted. Without access to version control (because they still use USB keys instead of Git), my task was to **reconstruct the missing file** using the provided `Account.hpp` header file, a test file (`tests.cpp`), and a log containing past program outputs.  

The challenge was to:  
- Analyze the **header file (`Account.hpp`)** to understand the class structure.  
- Use the **test file (`tests.cpp`)** to figure out what functions needed to be implemented.  
- Compare the programâ€™s output to the provided **log file** to ensure correctness (excluding timestamps, which naturally varied).  
- Ensure destructors were handled correctly, even though their execution order might differ depending on the compiler.  

### What I Learned  

By completing this exercise, I improved my **ability to analyze existing code and implement missing functionality** in a structured way.
